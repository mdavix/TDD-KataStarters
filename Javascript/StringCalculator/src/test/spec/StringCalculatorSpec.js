/**
 * Before you start:
 *  The following is a TDD Kata exercise in coding, refactoring and test-first.
 *  Try not to read ahead.
 *  Read each rule on their own, implement the necessary tests, refactor then move onto the next rule.
 *  Focus on testing for correct inputs only.
 *
 * The String Calculator Kata
 *  1. Create a simple String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers)
 *  2. The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0) for example “” or “1” or “1,2”
 *  3. Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbers
 *  4. Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
 *  5. Remember to refactor after each passing test
 *  6. Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
 *  7. Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
 *     a. the following input is ok:  “1\n2,3”  (will equal 6)
 *     b. the following input is NOT ok:  “1,\n” (not need to prove it - just clarifying)
 *  8. Support different delimiters
 *     a. to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this:   “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]” for example “//;\n1;2” should return three where the default delimiter is ‘;’ .
 *     b. the first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported
 *  9.Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception “negatives not allowed” - and the negative that was passed.if there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message
 *  10. Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001  = 2
 *  11. Delimiters can be of any length with the following format:  “//[delimiter]\n” for example: “//[***]\n1***2***3” should return 6
 *  12. Allow multiple delimiters like this:  “//[delim1][delim2]\n” for example “//[*][%]\n1*2%3” should return 6.
 *  13. Make sure you can also handle multiple delimiters with length longer than one char
